Alicia Storage:

Claude prompt - 
I want to build a service that I can host on a raspberry pi but develop on my laptop and update through ssh.  The service should be accessible to everyone at my house on my wifi network.  I want the service to be an inventory system for clothes.  The user would typically see a home screen which has a picture of storage containers that the user uploads to the service.  They can then click on a storage container which loads a new webpage showing all of the clothing that is stored inside of that storage container.  Each of these clothing articles can have various properties attached to them such as: sold or not sold, purchase price, sell price, date of storage, notes.  The user can click on each individual clothing item to change these properties.  When they adjust the sold property, meaning the article has been sold, there needs to be an indicator showing that item is sold.  The user should be able to upload new containers and attach new clothing articles from their cell phone using a web browser on their phone.  Can you help me?
